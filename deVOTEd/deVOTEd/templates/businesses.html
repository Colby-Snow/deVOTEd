        the enviroment that we all live in. There is so much individuals as well as businesses can do to donate
        their time and energy for a cause that hits home and complements our identities as human beings.

        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>
            It's easy! All you have to do is sign up for future events. Create a username and password, and search for local projects.
            If you want to volunteer by yourself, perhaps enjoy the solitude of nature. Or volunteer on a team, where you can develop friendships,
            and cultivate connections.

        <h2>Get some coin!</h2>
        <p>
            Here at deVOTEd we like the idea of rewarding those will helpful hands. Whenever a volunteer participates in an event, they get to accrue
            coin, which is our currency that allows people to make purchases in the marketplace.

        <h2>View our marketplace!</h2>
        <p>
            Our marketplace is a spot to buy sway! Once you accumulate coin you make purchases from our online store, ranging from tedding bears,
            to blankets, sweatshirts, etc.
